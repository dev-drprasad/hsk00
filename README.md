## API

‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE YOU RUN ANY COMMAND, BACKUP YOUR SD CARD ‚ö†Ô∏è
<br /><br />

### `add`

Adds game(s) to given category (Sports, Adventure etc..)

`--category` number starts from 0, left to right in menu. Example: "Sports Games" category number is `4`.

`--root` is root directory of game folder where `Menu.ocv` exists (can be sd card path or custom directory where files present)

**Example:**

```shell
hsk00-darwin-amd64 add  in/Famicom_Wars.nes  in/Heavy_Barrel.nes  in/Fantasy_Zone.nes  in/Final_Fantasy_II.nes --category 4 --root ~/Datafrog
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This will change menu text slightly ‚ö†Ô∏è. If you can't lanuch games or change menu page, restore files with your backup.

<br />

### `replace`

Replace will replace existing game with custom game.

Not implemented yet

---

<br />

### `descramble`

Converts `*.asd` files to usable `.zip` files. Output filename will be `<inputfilename>.zip` and will be generated in same directory where input file present.

Example:

```
hsk00-darwin-amd64 descramble  ~/Datafrog2/Game04/hsk06.asd
```

Let me know if it works with other consoles. It helps other people

## TODO

- [ ] May be GUI ?
- [ ] replace game
- [ ] delete game

## Need Help

I am not able to understand what are `GameXX.bin`, `Menu.logXX` files. They have background images, and menu selection images hidden them. But I am not able to determine offset of these images. If you know anything about these files, please let me know.
