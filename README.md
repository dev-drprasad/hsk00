## hsk00

Add/Replace games to your "Data Frog Y2 (568 in 1)" console. This is CLI tool. Download it from releases page

üöß **This is not ready yet** üöß

### API

‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE YOU RUN ANY COMMAND, BACKUP YOUR SD CARD ‚ö†Ô∏è

#### `Make`

`make` command generates `hskXX.asd` and `hsk00.asd` files with custom games in it
‚ö†Ô∏è This won't change game menu, you still see old list. ‚ö†Ô∏è

If you can't lanuch games or change menu page, restore files with your backup

**Example:**

```shell
hsk00 make --in in/Famicom_Wars.nes --in in/Heavy_Barrel.nes --in in/Fantasy_Zone.nes --in in/Final_Fantasy_II.nes --in in/Gauntlet_II.nes   --out hsk06.asd  --hsk00 hsk00.asd
```

This will generate new `hsk06.asd` and update `hsk00.asd`. Copy these two to `GameXX` directory. Your new games are available from number #25 to #30 (from `(06-1)*5` to `06 * 5`)

### Supported Consoles

- DATA FROG Y2 HD (568 in 1)
- Extreme Mini HD Game Box
- Probably works with SD card that looks like below

![data-frog-sd-card-files](./data-forg-sd-card-files.png)

Let me know if it works with other consoles. It helps other people

### Need Help

I am not able to understand what are `GameXX.bin`, `Menu.logXX` files. They have background images, and menu selection images hidden them. But I am not able to determine offset of these images. If you know anything about these files, please let me know.
