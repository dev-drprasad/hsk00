<br />

## CLI

**Download CLI :**

- [Mac OS X CLI](https://github.com/dev-drprasad/hsk00/releases/download/latest/hsk00-osx-cli)
- [Linux CLI](https://github.com/dev-drprasad/hsk00/releases/download/latest/hsk00-linux-cli)
- [Windows CLI](https://github.com/dev-drprasad/hsk00/releases/download/latest/hsk00-windows-cli.exe)

For Linux and OS X binaries, you need to give executable permission by running command `chmod +x <filename>`.

<br />

### `add`

Adds game(s) to given category (Racing, Adventure etc..)

`--category` number starts from `0`, left to right in menu. Example: "Racing Games" category number is `4`.

`--root` is root directory of game folder where `Menu.ocv` exists (can be SD card path or custom directory where files present)

**Example:**

```shell
hsk00-darwin-amd64 add nesroms/Famicom_Wars.nes  nesroms/Heavy_Barrel --category 4 --root ~/Datafrog
```

‚ö†Ô∏è This will change menu text slightly and sorts games by alphabetical order

If you can't lanuch games or change page, restore files with your backup.

<br />

### `replace`

Replace will replace existing game with new game.

Not implemented yet

<br />

### `descramble`

Extracts hidden files from scrambled files. Output filename will be `<inputfilename>.<hidden-file-ext>` and will be generated in same directory where input file present. Can extract hidden zip files and image files

Example 1:

```
hsk00-darwin-amd64 descramble  ~/Datafrog2/Game04/hsk06.asd
```

Example 2:

```
hsk00-windows-cli.exe descramble  F:\Game04\Game01.bin --out F:\Game04\Page01-GameList.jpg
```

<br />

### `scrambled-zip`

Generates scrambled `asd` type files from given mutliple files. Input files can be anything. This is low level API. If you're uncertain what this command do, probably you don't need this command.

Example:

```
hsk00-darwin-amd64 scrambled-zip file1.nes file2.nes --out hskXX.asd
```

### `scramble`

This command is removed in favour of `scrambled-zip` from v0.2.0.

Let me know if it works with other consoles. It helps other people

## TODO

- [ ] replace game
- [ ] delete game

## Need Help

I am not able to understand what are `GameXX.bin`, `Menu.logXX` files. They have background images, and menu selection images hidden them. But I am not able to determine offset of these images. If you know anything about these files, please let me know.
