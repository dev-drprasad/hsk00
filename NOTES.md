- Console is able to extract `.asd` files with 6.5 MB
- seems like rom size should be less than 1 MB for to play
- seen problem with multi-cart roms
- random names for `.asd` and `.bin` files works as long as `hsk00.asd` file is updated
- ncs files are just like asd files. `descramble` command can extract game from `.ncs` file
- Menu.logXX are also images. `Menu.log07` to `Menu.log25` contains mushroom selector in menu
- `.logXX`, `.binXX` are interchangeble
- XOR of `c8` and value at offset: `04` (.bin, logXX) will give image starting first two bytes
- In "(1400 + 520 rus) model", hsk00.asd contains animated mushroom slices, but in "Y2 model", hsk00.asd contains game list
- `Menu.ocv` (both Y2 and Y2 plus) contains background music
-
- `classics_menu_ok.drm` (Not sure from which console) and `Menu.ocv` (from Y2) have same music. But their content is different though
- Files that starts with `SP_ToneMaker`/`SPF2ALP` contains music/sound
- I assumed `Menu.ocv` contains PCM raw data and played with audacity (8bit unsinged, Mono, saample rate: 22050), I hear music, but there is too much noise. Either my settings are wrong or its not PCM
- G+ gadget audio file batch converter can be used to make "data frog Y2" supported music.

  - Alogirthm: H/W PCM 16-Bit (DRM)
  - I tried with sample rates: 22050, 11025 wav input files
  - Output drm file more than 3MB didn't work for me
